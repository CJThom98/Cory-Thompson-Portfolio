                I graduated from John Brown University back in May of 2020. I had earned my Bachelors degree in History with a minor in Museum Studies. Though I originally began as a Social Studies Secondary Education major. I always wanted to teach history and thought that becoming a teacher would be the best course. However, I came to the conclusion that becoming an educator would be incredibly restrictive.

                I've always been a creative person, and that creativity has gone into my love of history. I'm always looking for new ways to consume and teach history. To me, history can be taught and learned through many avenues, whether it's the traditional routes of scholarly research and presentations, or the interactivity of YouTube videos, video games, museums, and websites. Lately, I've been viewing the latter as the best route for history.

                Websites, and the Internet as a whole, offer plenty more opportunities for the world of history that goes beyond sharing resources and scholarly articles. We could have websites that could act as time machines, like what Ancestry.com did back in 2012 when they allowed users to travel back to 1940 and live a life based on a series of prompts. Websites could even streamline historical content exploration, such as Armchairhistory.tv where they have an interactive map based on historical periods and videos can be located by clicking on regions. The possibilities are endless and my hope is to be a contriubtor to this ever growing field.
