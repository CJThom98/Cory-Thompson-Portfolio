                Because I believe we can do so much more with technology in the classroom than smart boards and
                digital textbooks. Lets face it, education has not really changed since the technological revolution. Yes,
                we added some digital tools to the experience, but we have not fundamentally changed the way a
                student is taught or learns information.
            </p>
            <p>
                I envision a future where students pursue much of their education on their own and the teacher acts as
                a guide and mentor. Instead of just reading about life during the Great Depression, a student, via a web
                portal, can “time travel” and live a life based on a series of prompts while at the same time learn the
                necessary concepts to meet standards. I would love to see more digital engagement between museums and
                the classroom where history can be brought to life and students are encouraged to be curious, lifelong
                learners. Students in today's classrooms are digital natives and yet we teach them like they live in an
                analog world.

                I realized that to be a part of revolutionizing the classroom I had to learn the language of technology.
                Boot camp got me started on that journey and I am ready to build upon the basic skills I have acquired.
                In the days ahead I hope to not only contribute to the success of the company I join but also gain
                experience that will help educate the students of tomorrow.
